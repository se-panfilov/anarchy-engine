# Security Policy — anarchy-legal

**Effective date:** TBD until market release
**Security Contact:** TBD until market release (email preferred for sensitive reports)

## Scope

This policy covers the **open-source code** in \***\*. It is provided for community coordination only and **does not create service levels (SLAs), warranties, or contractual obligations**. Third-party binaries or downstream products are **out of scope\*\*.

## Reporting (CVD)

- **Report:** email **TBD until market release** with a minimal reproduction, affected commit/tag, and impact (if known). If possible, include a short patch or mitigation suggestion.
- **Public disclosure:** please coordinate timing with us to allow a fix or mitigation to be available where reasonably possible.

## Handling & Disclosure

This is a volunteer-maintained project. We’ll make a **good-faith effort** to review and prioritize reports; **no timelines are promised**. We may publish an advisory if the issue materially impacts users. There is **no bug bounty** unless explicitly announced.

### Research Guidelines (please follow)

- Avoid accessing, modifying, or exfiltrating data you do not own; minimize impact and stop testing if you encounter personal data.
- Do not perform tests that degrade availability for others (e.g., volumetric DoS).
- Only test assets reasonably within this repository’s scope; third-party platforms and distribution channels are out of scope.
- Comply with applicable law and third-party terms.

## Version Support

We generally address issues on **main** and the **latest stable** release. Older releases may not receive fixes; please upgrade.

## Advisories

If warranted, we will publish a security note or advisory in the repository (e.g., \***\*, release notes, or the advisories section). There is **no SLA\*\*.

## In / Out of Scope

- **In scope:** issues that materially impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the code in this repository or its documented update/build mechanisms.
- **Out of scope:** social engineering, physical attacks, denial-of-service on third-party platforms, vulnerabilities in third-party stores or OS kernels not packaged with this project, issues in unofficial forks or repackaged distributions.

## Safe Harbor

We welcome good-faith research that avoids privacy violations and service disruption. If you comply with this policy and act in good faith, we **do not intend** to pursue legal action **solely** for your security research on this project. This policy does not authorize unlawful activity or override third-party terms, and it does not protect actions that cause harm or data loss.

**Governing Law:** subject to mandatory law, matters under this policy are handled under **The Netherlands/Amsterdam**.
