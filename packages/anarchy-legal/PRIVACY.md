**Effective date:** TBD until market release
**Controller:** Sergei Aleksandrovich Panfilov — Contact: TBD until market release

**Scope / Identification.** This notice applies to the **open-source repository** for **anarchy-legal** (hosted on or mirrored to \***\*). We do **not\*\* operate a consumer service through this repository.

**CPRA (California):** we **do not sell or share** personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.

## 1. Repository Interactions

If you open issues, pull requests, or discussions, the content you submit (including your profile/handle and any attachments) becomes **public** on \***\* and is processed under that platform’s privacy policy. We may process this **public** information to operate, maintain, and improve the project.
**Legal basis:** our **legitimate interests** in running the OSS project.
**Retention:** issue/PR/discussion history is retained as part of the **public project record\*\*. Edits/deletions are handled through the platform’s features; historical records (e.g., git history) may persist.

## 2. Communications

If you email **TBD until market release**, we process your **email address**, **message content**, and any information you provide to respond.
**Legal basis:** our **legitimate interests** in responding to inquiries (or your **consent**, where applicable).
**Retention:** **24 months** from the date of our **last interaction in the support thread** (or ticket closure), then deletion or **irreversible anonymization**, unless longer retention is required by law or to establish, exercise, or defend **legal claims**.

## 3. Processors & Transfers

We may use service providers (e.g., email or CI hosting) as **processors**, bound by data-processing terms and our instructions. Where personal data is transferred outside your jurisdiction, we rely on recognized transfer mechanisms (e.g., **Standard Contractual Clauses**) where required by law.

## 4. Your Rights

Where applicable, you may request **access**, **rectification**, **erasure**, **restriction**, **objection**, or **portability** at **TBD until market release**. You may also contact your local supervisory authority. We may request reasonable information to **verify your identity** before acting on a request and will respond **within timelines required by applicable law**.

## 5. Security

We apply appropriate technical and organizational measures proportionate to the limited personal data we handle in connection with the repository (e.g., encrypted transport, access controls, limited retention). We do **not** use automated decision-making that produces legal or similarly significant effects.

## 6. Children

This project is intended for developers and is **not** directed to children.

## 7. Changes

We may update this notice by committing changes to the repository (the commit history indicates the effective date of each version). Material updates may also be summarized in the repository’s release notes or documentation.

## Governing Language

This **notice** is drafted in English. Translations may be provided for convenience. In markets where local-language versions are required by law for clarity and fairness, the local-language version controls to the extent required by applicable law; otherwise, the English version controls.
