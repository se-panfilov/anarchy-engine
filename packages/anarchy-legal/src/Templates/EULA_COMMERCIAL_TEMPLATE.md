## Severability

## 1. License Grant

Subject to this EULA, Licensor grants you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable license to install and use {{PACKAGE_NAME}} on devices you own or control for {{USAGE_SCOPE}} purposes, and—subject to Section 3—to make and distribute copies as permitted therein.

## 2. Ownership

The Game is licensed, not sold. {{LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME}} and its licensors retain all title and IP rights. **Open-source components** are licensed under their respective terms.

## 3. Permitted Use, Sharing & Reverse Engineering

You may:

- install and use the Game on devices you own or control;

- reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, analyze and modify the Game to the extent permitted by applicable law **and** for interoperability, modding and educational purposes;
  {{#ALLOW_PERSONAL_SHARING}}
- share **unmodified** copies of the Game **free of charge** with other individuals, provided that you include this EULA, do not hold us responsible for any issues arising from such sharing, and only where this is not prohibited by applicable law or the terms of the relevant Distribution Channel.
  {{/ALLOW_PERSONAL_SHARING}}
  {{#ALLOW_COMMERCIAL_RESALE}}

  {{/ALLOW_COMMERCIAL_RESALE}}

You must **not**:

- create, market, distribute or use **cheats, hacks, bots, aimbots, trainers, exploits** or other tools intended to gain an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, bypass anti-cheat, or compromise the integrity or security of the Game or others’ systems;
- develop, embed or distribute **malware** or use the Game as a vehicle for malicious code, phishing, or fraud;
- **impersonate** us or **mislead** users by presenting your builds as “official”, using confusingly similar names, or implying sponsorship, endorsement, or partnership without our prior written permission;
- violate applicable law or third-party rights when using, modifying, or sharing the Game.

We do **not** provide support, tools, or compatibility commitments for reverse engineering, modifications, or shared copies. Updates may break mods or unofficial builds, and we are **not liable** for any resulting loss or damage. Nothing in this section grants rights to our trademarks or proprietary assets beyond what is necessary for interoperability and nominative fair use.

Any distribution under this Section 3 is at your sole responsibility and expense. You act as the seller/distributor for legal purposes, and we provide no warranties, support, or obligations to your recipients.

- **do not harm** security, performance, or integrity of the Game or others’ systems;
- do **not** circumvent technical protection measures or unlawfully access proprietary assets.

We **do not** provide support, tools, or compatibility commitments for mods. Updates may break mods, and we are **not liable** for any loss or damage arising from mods. We may restrict or disable mods in online/competitive modes or where required for legal, safety, anti-cheat, or compliance reasons.

You retain rights in your mods. This EULA does **not** grant you any rights to our IP beyond what is necessary to interoperate with the Game. Do not include or redistribute our proprietary content unless expressly permitted.

{{#MOD_HOSTING}}
If we choose to host, feature, or distribute a mod, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, display, and redistribute that mod; you remain solely responsible for it.

The Game may receive updates, patches, bug fixes, or content changes (“Updates”). Updates may be delivered through any Distribution Channels in use from time to time, including automatic updates where supported, or by including updated files in the distribution package. Some Updates may be required to continue use.

Where we provide release notes or advisories, they may be delivered within the product, in the update package, or via the applicable Distribution Channel. No specific location or publication cadence is guaranteed.

We do **not** commit to any service levels, availability targets, or ongoing support unless expressly agreed in a separate written agreement.

## 7. User-Generated Content (if applicable)

Where UGC features exist, you remain responsible for your content. You grant Licensor a **worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free** license to use, reproduce, display, and adapt UGC for operating and promoting the Game. Licensor may remove content that violates this EULA or the law.

## 15. Changes

We may update this EULA. Material changes may be communicated **within the product or the update package** (for example, via an in-product notice, a prompt to review the EULA on update, or release notes included with the distribution), or via the applicable Distribution Channel. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.

## Governing Language
