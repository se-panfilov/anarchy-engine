We may restrict or disable mods in online/competitive modes or where required for legal, safety, anti-cheat, or compliance reasons.

This EULA is governed by the laws of **{{GOVERNING_LAW_COUNTRY}}** with venue in **{{GOVERNING_VENUE}}**.

If you are a Consumer, **mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence remain applicable**.

## 16. Changes

We may update this EULA. Material changes may be communicated **within the product or the update package** (e.g., in-product notice, prompt to review the EULA on update, or release notes included with the distribution), or via the applicable Distribution Channel. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.
