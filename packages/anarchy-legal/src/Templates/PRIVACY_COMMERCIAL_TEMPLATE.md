## 1. Summary

**CPRA:** we **do not sell or share** personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.

## 2. Game Client

- **No crash reports** are sent by default.
  {{#CRASH_OPT_IN}}
  If you **opt in**, the client may send **anonymous** crash reports limited to technical diagnostics (no direct identifiers). You can withdraw consent at any time in settings.
  {{/CRASH_OPT_IN}}

## 3. Distribution Channels

Your chosen Distribution Channels may process personal data necessary to provide their services (e.g., account or entitlement management). We receive only the minimal information needed to enable access to the Game (if applicable). For details on their processing, consult the terms and privacy documentation of the relevant provider.
