## 1. Summary

We do **not** collect personal data through the **offline** game client. Store platforms (e.g., **{{STORES_EXAMPLE_DATA_PROCESSOR}}**) process your data under their own privacy policies.

## 2. Game Client

- **No telemetry or analytics** are collected by the client.
- **No crash reports** are sent by default.
  {{#CRASH_OPT_IN}}
  If you **opt in**, the client may send **anonymous** crash reports limited to technical diagnostics (no direct identifiers). You can withdraw consent at any time in settings.
  {{/CRASH_OPT_IN}}
- The game runs offline. Any optional online features will be **opt-in** and documented here.

## 3. Store Platforms

Purchases, downloads, and account data are processed by **{{STORES_PURCHASES_PLATFORM}}**, acting under its own terms and privacy policy. We may receive minimal information (e.g., fulfillment status) necessary to provide access.

## 4. Customer Support

If you contact us at **{{SUPPORT_EMAIL}}**, we process your **email address**, **message content**, and any information you provide to respond.
**Legal basis:** our **legitimate interests** in responding to inquiries (or your consent where applicable).
**Retention:** **{{SUPPORT_EMAILS_RETAIN_PERIOD_MONTH}}**, then deletion or anonymization unless longer retention is required by law.

## 5. Processors

We may use service providers (e.g., email hosting) as **processors** bound by data processing terms. A list of key processors is available upon request.

## 6. International Transfers

Where data is transferred outside your jurisdiction, we rely on applicable transfer mechanisms (e.g., **standard contractual clauses** or other lawful safeguards), where required.

## 7. Your Rights

Subject to law, you may request **access**, **rectification**, **erasure**, **restriction**, **objection**, or **portability** at **{{PRIVACY_EMAIL}}**. You may also lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority (e.g., the Dutch **Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens**).
