## In/Out of Scope

- In scope: security issues that materially impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the shipped game or its update mechanism.

## Safe Harbor

If you comply with this policy and act in good faith, we **do not intend** to pursue legal action solely for your research on our game. This policy does not authorize any activity that would violate applicable law or third-party terms.
