# Security Policy — [GAME NAME]

**Effective date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Contact:** security@[YOUR-DOMAIN] (PGP below)

## Scope

This policy applies to commercial builds of **[GAME NAME]** distributed via **[STEAM / …]**. It describes how to contact us about potential security issues. **It does not create service levels, warranties, or contractual obligations.**

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email **security@[YOUR-DOMAIN]**. If available, include the affected version, platform, reproduction steps, impact, and a minimal PoC.
Optional PGP: see key below.
We ask researchers to act in good faith and avoid privacy violations, data exfiltration, or service disruption.

## How We Handle Reports

We **triage and prioritize** issues based on severity, exploitability, and user impact. **Response and remediation timelines may vary** depending on complexity and resource availability. We may contact you for clarification and, where appropriate, coordinate a disclosure window.

> Note: This policy **does not commit to any specific response time** and **does not provide an SLA**. Availability may be reduced during weekends, holidays, or maintenance windows.

## Legal/Regulatory Notifications

Where required by law, we will **notify competent authorities and/or users within the timelines mandated by applicable regulations** (for example, initial alerts for actively exploited vulnerabilities and subsequent follow-ups). Separate regulatory notices do not imply public disclosure.

## Updates & Delivery

Security updates are delivered through **[STORE AUTO-UPDATES]**. Release notes and advisories (when applicable) are posted at **[URL]**.

## In/Out of Scope

- In scope: security issues that materially impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the shipped game or its update mechanism.
- Out of scope: social engineering, physical attacks, denial-of-service on third-party platforms, vulnerabilities in third-party stores or OS kernels not packaged with the game.

## Safe Harbor

If you comply with this policy and act in good faith, we **do not intend** to pursue legal action solely for your research on our game. This policy does not authorize any activity that would violate applicable law or third-party terms.
