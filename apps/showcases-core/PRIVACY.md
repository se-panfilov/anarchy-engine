# Privacy Policy — TBD until market release

**Effective date:** TBD until market release
**Controller:** Sergei Aleksandrovich Panfilov — Contact: TBD until market release

**Scope / Identification.** This policy applies to **TBD until market release** (the “Software”) and related distributions under the following technical identifiers: `showcases-core`.

## 1. Summary

We do **not** collect personal data through the Software. Purchasing, downloading, installation, account, or entitlement functions (if any) are handled by the distribution channels you use and are subject to their own terms and privacy policies, which we do not control.

**CPRA (California):** we **do not sell or share** personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising and we do **not** process **sensitive personal information**.

## 2. The Software

- **No telemetry or analytics** are collected by the Software.
- **No crash reports** are sent by default.
- The Software operates locally (offline). Any optional online features will be **opt-in** and documented here.

## 3. Distribution channels

Your chosen distribution channels may process personal data necessary to provide their services (e.g., account or entitlement management). We receive only the minimal information needed to enable access to the Software (if applicable). For details on their processing, consult the terms and privacy documentation of the relevant provider.

## 4. Customer Support

If you contact us at **TBD until market release**, we process your **email address**, **message content**, and any information you provide to respond.

**Legal basis:** our **legitimate interests** in responding to inquiries (or your consent where applicable).

**Retention:** **24 months** from the date of our last interaction in the support thread (or ticket closure), then deletion or **irreversible anonymization**, unless longer retention is required by law or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

## 5. Processors

We may use service providers (e.g., email hosting) as **processors** bound by data-processing terms. A list of key processors is available upon request.

## 6. International Transfers

Where data is transferred outside your jurisdiction, we rely on applicable transfer mechanisms (e.g., **Standard Contractual Clauses** or other lawful safeguards), where required.

## 7. Your Rights

Subject to law, you may request **access**, **rectification**, **erasure**, **restriction**, **objection**, **portability**, and **withdrawal of consent** (for processing based on consent) at **TBD until market release**. You may also lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority (e.g., the Dutch **Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens**, Brazil’s **ANPD**, Canada’s **OPC**, Australia’s **OAIC**). We may request reasonable information to **verify your identity** before acting on a request. We will respond **within timelines required by applicable law**.

## 8. Children

This Software is **not directed** to children below the age requiring parental consent under applicable law (e.g., EU **16**, US **13**, China **14**). We do not knowingly process such data. If you believe we have collected such data, contact **TBD until market release** and we will address it in accordance with the law.

## 9. Security

We apply appropriate technical and organizational measures proportionate to the limited personal data we handle (e.g., encrypted transport, access controls, limited retention). We do **not** use automated decision-making that produces legal or similarly significant effects.

## 10. App-Store Disclosures (platform listings)

Where required by app-store programs (e.g., **privacy nutrition labels** / **data safety**), our listing reflects this policy. **Current expected status:** _“No data collected.”_ If optional crash reports are enabled by you, they may be disclosed under **Diagnostics** as **not linked to you** and **not used for tracking/advertising**. Store-specific summaries are provided in the store listing and may vary by version.

## 11. Changes

We may update this policy. Material changes may be communicated **within the product or the update package** (e.g., in-product notice or release notes), or via the applicable distribution channel.

## Governing Language

This policy is drafted in English. Translations may be provided for convenience. In consumer markets where local-language versions are required by law for clarity and fairness, the local-language version controls to the extent required by applicable law; otherwise, the English version controls.
