## Defined Terms

**“Distribution Channels”** means any store, marketplace, platform, launcher, website, installer, physical media, or other mechanism used now or in the future to distribute showcases-core, regardless of provider.

**“Consumer”** means an individual acting wholly or mainly outside their trade, business, craft or profession.

**“Business User”** means a user who is not a Consumer.

## Severability

If any term (including any limitation or exclusion of liability) is found invalid, unfair or unenforceable under applicable consumer protection law, the remainder remains in force and, where a term would be valid with a modification, it shall apply with the minimum modification necessary to make it valid.

## 1. License Grant

Subject to this EULA, Licensor grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use showcases-core on devices you own or control for purposes.

## 2. Ownership

The Game is licensed, not sold. Sergei Aleksandrovich Panfilov and its licensors retain all title and IP rights. **Open-source components** are licensed under their respective terms.

## 3. Permitted Use, Sharing & Reverse Engineering

You may:

- install and use the Game on devices you own or control;
- make personal backup copies for your own use;
- reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, analyze and modify the Game to the extent permitted by applicable law **and** for interoperability, modding and educational purposes;
- share **unmodified** copies of the Game **free of charge** with other individuals, provided that you include this EULA and do not hold us responsible for any issues arising from such sharing.
- distribute or resell the Game commercially **as an unofficial build**, provided that you (i) clearly and prominently state that your distribution is **unofficial and not endorsed** by us, (ii) do **not** use our trademarks, logos or branding beyond nominative fair use, (iii) include this EULA and all third-party notices, and (iv) do not modify or bundle the Game with malware, adware, or telemetry.

You must **not**:

- develop, embed or distribute **malware** or use the Game as a vehicle for malicious code, phishing, or fraud;
- **impersonate** us or **mislead** users by presenting your builds as “official”, using confusingly similar names, or implying sponsorship, endorsement, or partnership without our prior written permission;
- violate applicable law or third-party rights when using, modifying, or sharing the Game.

We do **not** provide support, tools, or compatibility commitments for reverse engineering, modifications, or shared copies. Updates may break mods or unofficial builds, and we are **not liable** for any resulting loss or damage. Nothing in this section grants rights to our trademarks or proprietary assets beyond what is necessary for interoperability and nominative fair use.

## 4. Modding

You may create, use, and distribute mods for the Game **at your own risk**, provided that your mods:

- comply with applicable law and **do not infringe** third-party rights;
- **do not harm** security, performance, or integrity of the Game or others’ systems;
- do **not** circumvent technical protection measures or unlawfully access proprietary assets.

We **do not** provide support, tools, or compatibility commitments for mods. Updates may break mods, and we are **not liable** for any loss or damage arising from mods. We may restrict or disable mods in online/competitive modes or where required for legal, safety, anti-cheat, or compliance reasons.

You retain rights in your mods. This EULA does **not** grant you any rights to our IP beyond what is necessary to interoperate with the Game. Do not include or redistribute our proprietary content unless expressly permitted.

## 5. Updates

The Game may receive updates, patches, bug fixes, or content changes (“Updates”). Updates may be delivered through any Distribution Channels in use from time to time, including automatic updates where supported, or by including updated files in the distribution package. Some Updates may be required to continue use.

Where we provide release notes or advisories, they may be delivered within the product, in the update package, or via the applicable Distribution Channel. No specific location or publication cadence is guaranteed.

We do not commit to any service levels, availability targets, or ongoing support unless expressly agreed in a separate written agreement.

## 6. Third-Party Services

Purchasing, downloading, installation, account, or entitlement functions may be provided by your chosen Distribution Channels and are subject to their own terms and privacy policies. Any online features of the Game (if offered) may rely on third-party services under their respective terms.

## 7. User-Generated Content (if applicable)

Where UGC features exist, you remain responsible for your content. You grant Licensor a **worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free** license to use, reproduce, display, and adapt UGC for operating and promoting the Game. Licensor may remove content that violates this EULA or the law.
