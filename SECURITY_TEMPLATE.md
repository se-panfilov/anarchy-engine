# Security Policy — [FRAMEWORK NAME] (Open Source)

**Effective date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Contact:** security@[YOUR-DOMAIN] (email preferred for sensitive reports)

## Scope

This policy covers the **open-source code** in **[REPO URL]**. It is provided for community coordination only and **does not create any service levels, warranties, or obligations**. Third-party binaries or downstream products are **out of scope**.

## Reporting

Email **security@[YOUR-DOMAIN]** with a minimal reproduction, affected commit/tag, and impact if known. If you can, include a short patch or mitigation suggestion.

## Handling & Disclosure

This is a volunteer-maintained project. We will make a **good-faith effort** to review reports and, where feasible, prepare a fix or mitigation and coordinate disclosure. **Timelines are indicative only** and may vary significantly based on severity and maintainer availability. We may close out-of-scope or low-risk issues without a separate advisory.

## Version Support

We generally address issues on **main** and the **latest stable** release. Older releases may not receive fixes; please upgrade.

## Advisories

If an issue warrants it, we will publish an advisory in **[GitHub Security Advisories / RELEASE NOTES]**. There is **no bounty program** and **no SLA**.

## Safe Harbor

We welcome good-faith research that avoids privacy violations and service disruption. This policy does not authorize unlawful activity or override third-party terms.
