Done:
- 3.x.x Physics
- 3.5.x Kinematic movement
- 4.x.x Spatial grid detection
- 5.x.x Raycasting & Collision detection

Roadmap:
- 6.0.x Complex models
- 6.1.x Lines domain
- 7.x.x Animations
- 7.1.x Refactor Vector/TVectorWrapper (should be Vector everywhere)
- 8.0.x Sounds/Music
- 8.1.x Tags should be optional
- 8.2.x GUI
- 8.3.x Pausing (timers)
- 8.4.x Registries refactoring (explicitly register/not register entities)
- 8.5.x Logging
- 9.0.x Deletion (memory management)
- 9.1.x Production build fix (WASM)
- 9.2.x Building app (desktop/mobile) (might be not a part of an engine)
- 9.3.x Testing (screenshot tests)
- 10.0.x Split apps and engine
- 10.1.x Performance improvements (make sure actors, materials and env maps are async)
- 10.2.x Extract materials form actors
- 10.3.x npm package and a repo
- 11.0.x Shaders
- 12.x.x Save/Load

Global Refactoring:
- extract materials from actors, keep there an alias to a material to be able to reuse the same material
- feels like env map is not async at all (check for extra "await", and compare with vanila env map loading)
- "tags" should be optional everywhere
- Simplify positions and rotations (and scale), should be Vector3 when possible, not a wrapper probably

Bugs and issues:
- Registries might be a mistake: if I create "bullet" which extends "actor", the actor will be registered, not the bullet (which is unexpected)
- Timers are the issue (the game is paused when you are not in the tab, but timers such as "setTimeout" are still running)
- Production build is not working due to WASM integration

Also:
- Make stats enable/disable configurable via url params (?debug=true)
