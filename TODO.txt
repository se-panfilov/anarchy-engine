Done:
- 3.x.x Physics
- 3.5.x Kinematic movement
- 4.x.x Spatial grid detection
- 5.x.x  Raycasting & Collision detection

To be done:
- 6.0.x Complex models
- 6.1.x Lines domain
- 7.x.x Animations
- 8.0.x Sounds/Music
- 8.1.x GUI
- 8.2.x Logging
- 9.0.x Deletion (memory management)
- 9.1.x Building app (desktop/mobile) (might be not a part of an engine)
- 9.2.x Testing (screenshot tests)
- 9.3.x Split apps and engine
- 9.4.x npm package and a repo
- 10.x.x Shaders
- 11.x.x Save/Load

Global Refactoring:
- extract materials from actors, keep there an alias to a material to be able to reuse the same material
- feels like env map is not async at all (check for extra "await", and compare with vanila env map loading)
- "tags" should be optional everywhere
- Simplify positions and rotations (and scale), should be Vector3 when possible, not a wrapper probably

Also:
- Add line domain and let lines be created via config
- BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchies) with Grid-Based Spatial Partitioning for collision detection
- Make stats enable/disable configurable via url params (?debug=true)
