Done:
- 2.0.x Spaces
- 2.5.x Particles
- 2.6.x Environment maps
- 2.7.x Physics
- 3.0.x WASM
- 3.5.x Kinematic movement
- 4.x.x Spatial grid detection
- 5.x.x Raycasting & Collision detection
- 5.2.1 Production build fix (WASM)
- 6.0.x Complex models
- 7.x.x Animations
- 8.x.x Actors with models & animations
- 9.x.x Split resources and entities load from config (among others: extracted materials, models, etc from actors)
- 9.1.x Refactor Vector/TVectorWrapper, Euler/TEulerWrapper (should be Vector/Euler everywhere)
- 9.2.x Transform drive
- 10.0.x Refactor loops (physical, collision and etc) loops should be based on milliseconds, not frames. Only rendering loop should be based on frames
- 11.0.x Sounds/Music
- 12.0.x Fix Registries (should always return the same object)

Roadmap:
- 13.0.x Deletion and resource dispose (memory management)
- 14.x.x Save/Load configs (serialization)
- 15.0.0 Multiple scenes full support (unload/load scenes one after another)
- 16.0.x Split apps and engine (and add config for an app to set up engine)
- 17.0.x npm package and a repo for the engine
- 18.0.x Building app (desktop/mobile) (might be not a part of an engine)
- 19.x.x Load managers domain for resource loaders (audio, animations, envMaps, materials, models3d, textures, etc.)
- 20.0.x Lines domain
- 21.0.x Performance improvements (make sure materials and env maps are async)
- 22.x.x Postprocessing
- 23.0.x Shaders


Won't be implemented soon:
- GUI/UI/HUD/Menus: Leave it to the app (don't want to build a generic solution)

Global Refactoring:
- It feels like env map is not async at all (check for extra "await", and compare with vanilla env map loading)
- Check if it makes sense to replace Rapier with Havok
- Consider a single factory for all entities (actor, model, etc)

Bugs and issues:
- Registries might be a mistake: if I create "bullet" which extends "actor", the actor will be registered, not the bullet (which is unexpected)
- Timers are an issue (the game is paused when you are not in the tab, but timers such as "setTimeout" are still running)
- Production build is not working due to WASM integration
- #191823 Text3dTextures doesn't update text values on textures on change
- Maybe: Refactor withActive entities (use active$) (camera, renderer, etc)

Also:
- Make stats enable/disable configurable via url params (?debug=true)
- Screenshot testing is interesting, but it's a part of an app, not engine

Before release:
- Check every function in the engine that it's not calling every second (with adding console.log everywhere)
