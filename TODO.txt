To be done:
- 3.x.x Physics
- 4.x.x Complex models
- 4.x.x Lines domain
- 5.x.x Animations
- 6.x.x Sounds/Music
- 6.x.x GUI
- 6.x.x Logging
- 7.x.x Deletion (memory management)
- 7.x.x Building app (desktop/mobile) (might be not a part of an engine)
- 7.x.x Testing (screenshot tests)
- 7.x.x Split apps and engine
- 7.x.x npm package and a repo
- 8.x.x Shaders
- 9.x.x Save/Load

Global Refactoring:
- extract materials from actors, keep there an alias to a material to be able to reuse the same material

Also:
- should I add physics updates to the global loop? (like all physics objects in a registry should update attached actors?)
- actor position/rotation should be an observable
